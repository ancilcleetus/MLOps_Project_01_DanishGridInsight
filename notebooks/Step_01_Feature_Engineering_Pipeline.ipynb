        "- **Consumer Type:** The consumer type is the Industry Code DE35, owned and maintained by Danish Energy, a non-commercial lobby organization for Danish energy companies. The code is used by Danish energy companies.\n",

For data after June 2023, [please find data here](https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/ConsumptionDK3619codehour). The observations for this new dataset have a lag of 8 days & 11 hours."
